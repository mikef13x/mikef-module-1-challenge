# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
In this project we were assigned to fix and restyle the html code so that it follows a more semantic system, comment on the CSS, and deploy the website properly. This was our first homework assignment under module 1 in the coding bootcamp. This webpage is built for a company called "Horiseon" which specializes in Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.
